**1. Com.DanLiris.Service.Core.Lib**

This folder consists of various libraries, domain Models, View Models, and Business Logic.The Model and View Models represents the data structure. Business Logic has responsibility  to organize, prepare, manipulate, and organize data. The tasks are include entering data into databases, updating data, deleting data, and so on. The model carries out its work based on instructions from the controller.


AutoMapperProfiles:

- Colecction class to setup mapping data 

Helpers 

- Collection of helper classes that frequently used in various cases. 

Services

- Colecction of classes to  process bussiness logic and to prepare, manipulate, and organize data, including CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete ) on database.

Models:

- The Model is a collection of objects that Representation of data structure which hold the application data and it may contain the associated business logic.

ViewModels

- The View Model refers to the objects which hold the data that needs to be shown to the user.The View Model is related to the presentation layer of our application. They are defined based on how the data is presented to the user rather than how they are stored.

Migrations

- Collection of classes that generated by EF framework  to setup database and the tables.



Services

- Collection of classes and interfaces to validation and authentication user.

**TestResults**

- Collections of files generated by the system for purposes of unit test code coverage.


**CoreDbContext.cs**

This file contain context class that derives from DbContext in entity framework. DbContext is an important class in Entity Framework API. It is a bridge between domain or entity classes and the database. DbContext and context class  is the primary class that is responsible for interacting with the database.


**File Program.cs**

Important class that contains the entry point to the application. The file has the Main() method used to run the application and it is used to create an instance of WebHostBuilder for creating a host for the application. The Startup class to be used by the application is specified in the Main method.

**File Startup.cs**

This file contains Startup class. The Startup class configures services and the app's request pipeline.Optionally includes a ConfigureServices method to configure the app's services. A service is a reusable component that provides app functionality. Services are registered in ConfigureServices and consumed across the app via dependency injection (DI) or ApplicationServices.This class also Includes a Configure method to create the app's request processing pipeline.

**File .codecov.yml**

This file is used to configure code coverage in unit tests.

**File codeclimate.yml**

 CI (continuous integration) tool that is configured by adding a file named codeclimate.yml. This file in a YAML format text file, located in root directory of the repository. This file specifies the programming language used, the desired building and testing environment (including dependencies which must be installed before the software can be built and tested), and various other parameters.

**File docker-compose.test.yml**

File that configure docker compose. Docker compose provides a way to orchestrate multiple containers that work together.

**File Dockerfile**

A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.

**Com.DanLiris.Service.Core.sln**

File .sln is extention for *solution* aka file solution for .Net Core, this file is used to manage all project by code editor.
